# JavaScript Tasks Project

This repository contains various JavaScript tasks that demonstrate the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI interactions. The tasks are designed to practice core JavaScript skills such as handling user events, updating the DOM, and adding animations to web elements.

## Task List

### 1. **Classroom Tasks**
   - Tasks 1 through 6 were implemented as part of class exercises. They cover fundamental JavaScript concepts such as event listeners, DOM manipulation, and random number generation:
     - **Changing an element’s background color on click**
     - **Changing text of a button when clicked**
     - **Changing font size on hover**
     - **Toggling visibility of elements**
     - **Randomizing colors with button clicks and hovering**
     - **Random suggestion generation (IPL winner prediction)**

### 2. **Increase Div Size on Button Click**
   - Create a button that, when clicked, increases the size of an associated div box.

### 3. **Move Box to a Random Position**
   - Create a button that moves a box to a new random position each time it’s clicked.

### 4. **Like Counter for Button**
   - Implement a "like" counter for a button that increments the count displayed next to it when clicked.

### 5. **Mouse Follower**
   - Create a box that follows the mouse cursor as it moves around the screen.

### 6. **Hamburger Menu Animation**
   - Create an animated hamburger menu that changes to a "close" icon when clicked.

### 7. **Instagram-like Heart Animation on Double Click**
   - Create a feature similar to Instagram where double-clicking an image makes the heart icon enlarge.

### 8. **Dark Mode Toggle**
   - Add a "dark mode" button that toggles the background color of the page between black and white.

### 9. **Reset Text Area Button**
   - Add a reset button that clears all the text in a text area when clicked.

### 10. **Modal Popup**
   - Create a modal popup that appears when a button is clicked and disappears when clicking outside or pressing the "Close" button.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
2. Open the project in your browser by opening the index.html file.

3. The tasks will be displayed as individual interactive features. Click the buttons, hover over the elements, or try other interactions to see the JavaScript in action.

### **Technologies Used**
**HTML** - Structure of the pages.
**CSS** - Styling and layout.
**JavaScript** - Functionality and interactivity.
